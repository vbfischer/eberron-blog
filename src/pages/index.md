Taking place in the world of Eberron, a world of magic that is built into the very fabic of everyday life. Where "magic" and "science" are one in the same. Within Eberron, exists great cities with huge castles and sky scrapers, aristocratic families, who bear mysterious and rare dragonmarks, controlling the economy and people who harness magic as a tool to build cities and sail ships through the skies.

What is Eberron? It’s a world bound by a golden ring and surrounded by twelve moons. It’s the intersection of thirteen planes of existence, which shift in and out of alignment. It’s a place where magic has been harnessed as a tool—used to build cities, to sail ships through the skies, to create both wonders and weapons.

Eberron embraces swashbuckling action and pulp adventure and adds a layer of neo-noir intrigue. Stories don’t always end well and there isn’t a perfect answer to every problem.

The Last War turned old allies into bitter enemies and destroyed an entire nation, leaving terrible scars behind. Crime and corruption lurk in the great cities of Khorvaire. Hidden dragons shape the course of history. Sinister fiends influence the dreams of the unwary. Human greed and ambition may prove more dangerous than any devil or demon. But through this darkness, there are opportunities for a group of bold adventurers to make a difference… for better or for worse.
